**Hi there!** <br>
You're now on our UER repository.
Universal Exploring Rover project was to project, simulate, 3d print, build, test and program fully functional rover capable to grab items and samples. 
The goal has been fully achieved, so the project is finished.<br><br>
Features & specification:
- Controlled by any USB gamepad with analog joysticks (we use xbox clone gamepad)
- Wi-Fi is used as link between controller as rover
- Any fast enough device which support gamepad and Wi-Fi can be used as rover controller (for example: on my laptop Lenovo Legion Y520 everything works smooth)
- First person view (depends on hardware configuration, we used cheap usb web camera and it works fine)
- Capable of moving in any direction and rotating in any way just like the real rover (fully implemented Ackerman geometry)
- Plug-in hardware configuration (any device supporting USB, Wi-Fi and Linux can be used as rover on-board computer because all peripherials are connected by USB (in our configuration there's camera on USB, Wi-Fi dongle and two arduinos: first controlling rover's motors, second controlling rover's arm)
- Open source
